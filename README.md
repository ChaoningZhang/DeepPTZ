# DeepPTZ
Thanks for your interest in DeepPTZ: Deep Self-Calibration for PTZ Cameras (WACV2020).

To train the model, you need the training and validation dataset.
The dataset is available in https://cloud.frameau.xyz/index.php/s/ra4HCCweXaYKWTe
Alternatively, you can generate the dataset by your self from SUN360, with the code provided in the matlab folder.
With the dataset, you can run the code with command: bash run.sh.

For only evaluating the performance, you can use the pretrained model which is available at https://cloud.frameau.xyz/index.php/s/EgnEzJidkGkkbcQ

If you have any questions regarding the code or our work, please an isssue and we will address it.
