To train the model, you need the training and validation dataset.
The dataset is available in https://cloud.frameau.xyz/index.php/s/ra4HCCweXaYKWTe
Alternatively, you can generate the dataset by your self from SUN360, with the code provided in the matlab folder.

For only evaluate the performance, you can use the pretrained model which is available at https://cloud.frameau.xyz/index.php/s/EgnEzJidkGkkbcQ
