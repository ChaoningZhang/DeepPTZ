# DeepPTZ
Thanks for your interest in our work.
The code to reproduce the DeepPTZ (WACV2020).

It seems that the pretrained model can not be uploaded due to size limitation.
To train the code, please run the run.sh file.

To train or evaluate the model, you need to generate the dataset by your self from SUN360.
The code to generate the dataset is also provided in the matlab folder.

To faciliate using this code, the training and validation dataset as well as the pretrained model will be provided soon after we find a server to store it.

Contact through chaoningzhang1990@gmail.com if you need our dataset but find it is still empty here.
